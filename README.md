# TrashCollector

This was my first try at ASP.NET MVC, it allows people to put in their desired pick up date, adds ammount to their account upon pickup, lets them pick a specific pick up date, allows them to also pick a extra pick up day for if they ever need garbage picked up on a specific day. The workers only get people in their designated zip code as well. It doesn't show people in another collectors work area.
